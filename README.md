# Powerslide Kart Physics
This is an open source version of my kart physics system originally sold on the Unity Asset Store, tested in Unity versions from 2019.4.0f1 to 2022.x. You can also download a Unity package of the last version published to the Asset Store [here](https://justinvoke.com/gamefiles/Powerslide_Kart_Physics_1.07.unitypackage). Everything except the Assets/Packages folder is licensed under the MIT License.

Other branches feature unfinished race and battle mode features that I don't plan on completing.
